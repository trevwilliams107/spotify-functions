# spotify-functions

To do:
- Create a csv for each playlist, add each song, keeping order, create another csv which counts the appearances of each song in a playlist. Could potentially make this a google doc. This is for future data analysis
  -potential project: examine an artist's most popular songs in different countries
- Create function that makes a playlist, given a list of artists, add all of that artist's songs into the playlist
- Given a list of artists, make a playlist with the top 5 songs of that artist 
- Delete duplicate songs from a playlist
